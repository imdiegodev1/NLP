# NLP

NLP or Natural Language Processing is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language. In my way to become data scientist I did a lot of text mining process for different type of companies. Here I want to share with you some of the knowledge I got. You can find for now two folders:

- Basic Analytics: Those are scripts with basic process you can use to analyze text and see some plots like word frequency and word clouds.
- Advance Analytics: There are scripts more focuse on machine learning models using a latent Markovian model, NLTK and implementations of naive bayes model for text classification.

If you don't have data bases to test and learn, here are some examples that you can use to understand and play this [data set](https://github.com/pachocamacho1990/datasets). Hope you enjoy the scripts.
